Can This Massive As Heck Text Even Be Displayed On The Minecraft 1.13-1.19.3 Main Menu Splash Screen Without Changing Any GUI Scale Settings? I Don't Think So. Hopefully This Doesn't Cause Lag! Well, it cant, it looks like a pixelated non-aliased line. Well, I haven't tested it on 4K, but I guess I'm finding if it works on 4K 9 hours before 5.0 releases! Also now im making it longer for 5.1 (real) Yes, i made it even longer for [next major release] (real) I think we should Elongate Muskrät this line every time we add a new splash. I just realized on GitHub Mobile on my Motorola Moto G53 5G this single splashes.txt line is 15 lines long. I think Thinkseal has shown what this looks like in-game. I wonder if you could read this in an 8K or 16K screen. I guess we'll never know that, ever, lol! I wonder if I should remove this anytime soon.
The one and only!
